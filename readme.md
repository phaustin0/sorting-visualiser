# Sorting Algorithm Visualiser

This application was programmed with Python. If you have not installed Python, install it [here](https://python.org/downloads). Make sure that you have also installed `pip`

This application uses `pygame`. If you do not have it installed, write this command in your terminal emulator:

- If you are on Windows, <br />
` $ pip install -r requirements.txt`

- If you are on Mac/Linux, <br />
` $ sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Once you have pygame installed, go to the directory where the application is installed, and run `python main.py [number of bars (integer)] [sorting algorithm]`.

The four algorithms are:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort

After entering the right command, press `Space` to start the visualisation process
